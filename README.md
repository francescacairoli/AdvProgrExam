The exam consists of two main parts: a C++ project and a Pythonic one.
The c++ folder is organized as follows:

The python folder is organized as follows:
- the PostcardList class was implemented to read and write postcard addresses on text files. The folder also contains the unit tests file provided in the exercise assignemnts.
